<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>A group of Nigerian cyber actors responsible for operating the infracstructure associated with five malware families. These actors were predominately identified using domain registration details, which, in many cases, enabled Unit 42 to link these actors directly to their social media profiles.
Performing this practice on a large scale has produced tremendous insights into the size,
scope, motivations and interactions of these actors

Unit 42 have observed Nigerian actors using 15 separate commodity malware tools in support of modern business email compromise (BEC) schemes. In the past year alone, they have conducted an average of 17,600 attacks per month, demonstrating a 45 percent increase from 2016. These attacks span all major industry verticals and target businesses rather than individuals. These actors have learned how to successfully employ commodity malware tools to realize lucrative returns: according to the FBI, law enforcement now estimates that the exposed losses worldwide are more than US$3 billion.</p>
