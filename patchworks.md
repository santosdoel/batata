<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>

  Patchwork is a threat group observed since at least December 2015 targeting various industries and government organizations or related entities in the Middle East, South Asia nations, Europe, South Korea, the United States and others.

Patchwork conducts reconnaissance on their target copying news stories or documents that are of interest and delivers them via targeted spear phishing campaigns as an attachment or providing a link to an external domain. These documents exploit known vulnerabilities within various desktop applications and subsequently drop malware onto the victim host.

Common [multi-stage] malware used by these operators include: AutoIT, MyDoom, Metasploit, BADNEWS, TINYTYPHON, Powershell, and key loggers.

The use of Dead Drop Resolvers to communicate with a command and control domain or IP is often seen as well as the use of cloud infrastructure by Leaseweb or BELCLOUD. Many SSL certificates issued by Let's Encrypt have also been noted in association with their infrastructure activities.

Patchwork is believed to be operating within the Indian subcontinent based on infrastructure logins within that region.
