<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
Tick is a cyberespionage group known to target Japanese organizations such as government agencies (including defense) as well as those in biotechnology, electronics manufacturing, and industrial chemistry.
They have also been known to target Russian, Singaporean, and Chinese enterprises. Tick's attacks typically use spear phishing emails as an entry point.

The “Tick” group has conducted cyber espionage attacks against organizations in the Republic of Korea and Japan for several years. The group focuses on companies that have intellectual property or sensitive information like those in the Defense and High-Tech industries. The group is known to use custom malware called Daserf, but also employs multiple commodity and custom tools, exploit vulnerabilities, and use social engineering techniques.

  
This threat group also targeted a specific type of secure USB drive created by a South Korean defense company. The USB drive and its management system have various features to follow security guidelines in South Korea.
  
The weaponization of a secure USB drive is an uncommon attack technique and likely done in an effort to spread to air-gapped systems, which are systems that do not connect to the public internet. In addition, our research shows that the malware used in these attacks will only try to infect systems running Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Server 2003. This is despite the fact that the malware appears to have been created when newer versions of Windows software were available. This would seem to indicate an intentional targeting of older, out-of-support versions of Microsoft Windows installed on systems with no internet connectivity. Air-gapped systems are common practice in many countries for government, military, and defense contractors, as well as other industry verticals.
