<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Sofacy has been active since the mid 2000s, and have been responsible for targeted intrusion campaigns against various industry vertical such as but not limited to Aerospace, Defense, Energy, Government and Media. Extensive observation and research of Sofacy's activities over time indicated a profile closely mirroring the strategic interests of the Russian government. More recently, this group has been attributed to the GRU, Russia's premier military intelligence service as reported by the US intelligence community within several declassified public documents.

This adversary has been observed to have access to a wide range of implants, such as Coreshell, XAgent, Xtunnel, SofacyCarberp, as well as a variety of malware for non Windows platforms such as Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows Phones. They are also known for registering domain names closely resembling domains of legitimate organizations they are planning to target. Often times, credential harvesters may be deployed onto these sites in order to gather credentials to be repurposed for post-exploitation operations.

Several high profile intrusions have been publicly linked to the Sofacy group, such as the German Bundestag, France's TV5Monde TV station, the Democratic National Committee, the World Anti-Doping Agency, and the Ukrainian military.</p>
